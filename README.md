Detecting the Higgs Boson using RNN (LSTM)

## Dataset details

Dataset of 250000 events, with an ID column, 30 feature columns, a weight column and a label column. 

Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson/data

### Some details to get started: 
• all variables are floating point, except PRI_jet_num which is integer 
• variables prefixed with PRI (for PRImitives) are “raw” quantities about the bunch collision as measured by the detector. 
• variables prefixed with DER (for DERived) are quantities computed from the primitive features, which were selected by the physicists of ATLAS 
• it can happen that for some entries some variables are meaningless or cannot be computed; in this case, their value is −999.0, which is outside the normal range of all variables
